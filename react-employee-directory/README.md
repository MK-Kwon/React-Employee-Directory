# React-Employee-Directory

> A responsive, single-page React employee directory application that enables sorting and filtering employee data. The application uses React props, stateful and stateless components. The Bootstrap CSS framework is used for styling. For this assignment, I broke up the app's UI into components, managed component state and responded to user events. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view and filter non-sensitive data about other employees.
